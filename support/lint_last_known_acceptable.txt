internal/sshd/server_config.go:130:19: SA1019: ssh.KeyAlgoDSA is deprecated: DSA is only supported at insecure key sizes, and was removed from major implementations. (staticcheck)
internal/sshd/server_config_test.go:5:2: SA1019: "crypto/dsa" has been deprecated since Go 1.16 because it shouldn't be used: DSA is a legacy algorithm, and modern alternatives such as Ed25519 (implemented by package crypto/ed25519) should be used instead. Keys with 1024-bit moduli (L1024N160 parameters) are cryptographically weak, while bigger keys are not widely supported. Note that FIPS 186-5 no longer approves DSA for signature generation.
