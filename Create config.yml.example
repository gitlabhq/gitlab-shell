# URL to GitLab instance, used for API calls. Default: http://localhost:8080.
# For relative URL support read http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/install/relative_url.html
# You only have to change the default if you have configured Unicorn
# to listen on a custom port, or if you have configured Unicorn to
# only listen on a Unix domain socket. For Unix domain sockets use
