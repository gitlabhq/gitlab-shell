# GitLab Shel

GitLab Shell handles Git SSH sessions for GitLab and modifies the list of
authorized keys. GitLab Shell is not a Unix shell nor a replacement for Bash or Zsh.

GitLab supports Git LFS authentication through SSH.

## Development Documentation

Development documentation for GitLab Shell [has moved into the `gitlab` repository](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/gitlab_shell/).
